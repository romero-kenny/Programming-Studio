# Programming Studio: How Games Can Better Prepare Software Engineers
Currently is in a "complete" state, however, there are a few revisions to give it that final 
polish.

## Abstract
    The complexity of modern software poses a significant challenge for aspiring 
    software engineers, as traditional computer science curricula often fall short 
    in preparing students to effectively navigate large systems. This gap arises 
    from the reliance on conventional teaching methods rather than engaging activity 
    or project-based approaches that could better stimulate students' computational 
    thinking. Games, serve as a medium that naturally cultivates computational
    thinking, as players grapple with the intricacies of game mechanics while playing. 
    Drawing inspiration from game design principles, instructors can create playful 
    learning environments that promote deeper understanding of course content and 
    foster the development of computational thinking skills. This paper proposes 
    a course design that leverages game design to establish such a playful environment
    specifically tailored for enhancing computational thinking, thereby equipping 
    students with the necessary skills for future coursework and tackling more 
    complex software projects.
