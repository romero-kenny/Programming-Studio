	            game tied together through a meaningful storyline. The
	            application part targets the use of stacks to solve problems,
	            such as converting arithmetic expressions from infix to postfix
	            notation and evaluating postfix and infix expressions. The
	            implementation part involves solving Parson/s problems and

	            anniversary of the first documented game jam, the Indie Game Jam,
	            which took place in Oakland, California in 2002. Initially, game
	            jams were widely seen as frivolous activities. Since then, they
	            have taken the world by storm. Game jams have not only become
	            part of the day-to-day process of many game developers, but jams
	            are also used for activist purposes, for learning and teaching,
	            as part of the experience economy, for making commercial
	            prototypes that gamers can vote on, and more. Beyond only
	            surveying game jams and the relevant published scientific
	            literature from the last two decades, this paper has several
	            additional contributions. It builds a history of game jams, and

	            prepare students for a field that involves rapidly changing
	            conditions and expectations. Thus, there is always a danger that
	            the skills and the knowledge provided may soon become obsolete.
	            This paper describes results and draws on experiences from the
	            implementation of a computer game-development course whose design
	            addresses problems in software-engineering education by improving
	            students' abilities in four areas: (1) problem solving; (2) the
	            application of previously learned knowledge; (3) the use of
	            independent learning; and (4) learning by doing. In order to
	            better understand this course's effect on students' performance
	            in a software-development project, I investigated 125 students'
	            performance in a 1-year senior-project course. Results of this
	            study show that the students who had taken the computer
	            game-development course became more successful in the
	            senior-project course than the students who had not taken it.},

	abstract = {It has been long established that discrete structures is an
	            important and foundational component of the computer science
	            curriculum. However, the topics covered in this course tend to be
	            more abstract than those covered in most other introductory
	            computer science courses. This leads to additional challenges for
	            instructors and students. To deal with these challenges, we
	            introduce a new pedagogy for teaching this course. Our approach
	            is based on a variant of the flipped classroom paradigm and is
	            comprised of four main components: before class preparatory work,
	            in-class mini lecture, in-class team based problem solving
	            activities, and weekly individual assignments. In this paper, we
	            discuss these components in detail. Our approach is informed by
	            several cutting-edge teaching methodologies including active
	            learning, light weight teams, and gamification. We conclude the
	            paper by discussing the results of a survey taken by the students
	            and a summary of the grades attained in the class. These show
	            that our approach was well received by the students and has led
	            to good learning outcomes.},
